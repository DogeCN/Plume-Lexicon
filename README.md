# Translator
**A simple locale translation tool at your service.**

### Backstory
 In my quest of *4000 Essential Words* , I grappled with unfamiliar terms that were hard to comprehend and summarize. Hence, the idea for this app blossomed.
 I recallimg the torturous dictionary loading phase but today, everything's smooth sailing: correcting errors, batch processing, even printing them out. A notable enhancement indeed!
 Along the way, countless words swimming around in my head —— more than 600, to be precise. Thanks for sticking with me these past few months! And also supports from community.
